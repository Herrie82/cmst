Program icons are located in the ./variations subdirectory.  

To build one into the program either copy or symlink the icons you wish
to use into this directory and call them: cmst.png and cmst.svg.  You need 
both the 48x48 PNG version and scalable SVG versions copied.  

If you wish to use the freedesktop theme icon (preferences-system-network) for
the program icon then simply do not copy or symlink a cmst.png file.  The
scalable version is ignored if the 48x48 PNG version does not exist. If 
the 48x48 verison is not found the theme icon will be used instead. 

The 24x24 directory is depreciated now and may be removed in the future.
