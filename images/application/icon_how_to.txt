Program icons are located in the ./variations subdirectory.  

To build one into the program either copy or symlink the icon you wish
to use into this directory and call it: cmst.png

If you wish to use the freedesktop theme icon (preferences-system-network) for
the program icon then simply do not copy or symlink an icon here.  If an icon
is not found the theme icon will be used instead.
